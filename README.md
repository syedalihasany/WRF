Start by following the instructions menitoned on this link:
https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compilation_tutorial.php
after completing the steps for 'System Environment Tests' start reading the instructions for 'Building Libraries' 
but make sure to build the packages that are mentioned in 'issues.txt' as some of the packages mentioned on the
link are outdated and some paths that are set have wrong paths! Therefore it is important that you read the 
issues.txt file in parallel in order to get WRF set up correctly.
